#### How to set up
Create a folder with your training data and specify the path where the *load_images_from_folder* function is called. Create another one named "Augmented". This is where the augmented dataset will be found after running the program.
#### Changing the training data resolution
You can manually set the resolution of the images from the dataset by changing the "dsize" tuple.
